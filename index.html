             <Did you know that in school year 2017 – 2018, 2.9 million Filipino learners belonged in 
              indigenous groups while there are 22,129 Filipino learners who have disability/special education 
              needs? The Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) also reported that majority of the out-of-school 
              children and youth are females. However, the PSA also reported that significantly more females were 
              getting advanced degrees than male (San Buenaventura, 2019). In education, Statistics can also be 
              used when the teacher calculates for a student’s grade or when the teacher does an item analysis to 
              check the degree of difficulty and reliability of the exam. Statistics is also used to determine what 
              teaching strategy is better than the other. 
               
              Did you know that the prices received by farmers for their palay production went up by 
              4.48% in 2017? The Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) also reported that in the same year, 25.44% 
              of the national employment belong in the agriculture sector and our country’s earnings from 
              agricultural exports has increased by 24.61% (Philippine Statistics Authority, 2018). In agriculture, 
              Statistics is important to see the trend and predict the population levels of plants and animals. 
              Statistics is also used in different branches of agricultural science such as field crop production and 
              horticulture.>
